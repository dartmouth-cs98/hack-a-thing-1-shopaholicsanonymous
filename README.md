## This project will explore building out a google chrome extension

# Purpose 
## Delay rethink impulse buying to put more though into it
## Also to help saving by remining you of financial goals

# Design Idea
## This extension is to have a pop up everytime you go to 'buy' or 'pay now'
## will ask if you'd rather save the money and offer redirecing to your savings account
## Will remind you of the financial goals you *should* be saving for

# Set Up Prior Information Needed Before Use
## Will have bank name itself to redirect to website (just the website, not the login)
## 3 financial goals you're saving for

# Stretch functionality
## User is able to disable extention for certain sites
## User is able to label 'essentials' that are exempt from being flagged
## Being able to detect the contents of the cart and non having pop up for things on 'essentials' list
## or....having a user input high risk websites they are concerned about spending money on
